# sentiment_analysis_vote_intenction(NLP)
This repository was the capstone project for the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning course offered by Tera. I used Twitter Data to perform Sentiment Analysis and NLP techniques and infer the votes intention of Brazilian's citizens. The codes are very adjusted to my specific problem and Data, but the logic would help you in your own project =)

The project was compounded in several steps. The main of them are available in this repository as three different Jupyter Notebooks: (1) tweet_collector, (2) data_preprocessing, and (3) ML_Classifier. The logic sequence in which they were applied and their function are graphically represented in the following image:
