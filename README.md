# sentiment_analysis_vote_intention(NLP)
This repository was the capstone project for the Data Science &amp; Machine Learning course offered by Tera. I used Twitter Data to perform Sentiment Analysis and NLP techniques and infer the votes intention of Brazilian's citizens. The codes are very adjusted to my specific problem and Data, but the logic would help you in your own project =)
