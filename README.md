# sentiment_analysis_vote_intention(NLP)
This repository was the capstone project for the Data Science & Machine Learning course offered by Tera. I used Twitter Data to perform Sentiment Analysis and NLP techniques (such as Sentiment Analysis) to infer the voting intention of Brazilian citizens in the 2022 elections. The codes are very adjusted to my specific problem and Data, but the logic would help you in your own project =)

The project was composed of several stages, from data collection to the result's interpretation. The flowchart below summarize the main steps, representing in which stage of the process each Notebook was used and its purpose.
